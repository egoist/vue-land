For popular libraries, we encourage the authors to use a channel on our Discord server for users to chat. For example, we have a <channel name="nuxtjs" /> channel for Nuxt.js while people might be also interested in server-side rendering, so they can use <channel name="ssr" /> channel for common SSR topics too.

Maybe we can finally have the whole Vue community fit in a single place.
